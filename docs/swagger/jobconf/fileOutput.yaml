  The Checkita framework supports saving its results to a file in various formats and locations, such as local or remote (HDFS, S3) file systems. 
  This includes saving virtual sources built during Data Quality job execution for future investigation and saving Data Quality job results. 
  File outputs can be configured in different formats including delimited text, ORC, Parquet, and Avro.
