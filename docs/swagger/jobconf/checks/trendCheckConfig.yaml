  - metric
  - rule
  - windowSize
properties:
  metric:
    type: string
    description: Metric ID which results is checked.
    example: some_metric_id
  rule:
    type: string
    description: The rule for calculating the historical average value of the metric
    enum:
      - record
      - datetime
    example: datetime
  windowSize:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Size of the window for average metric value calculation. 
        * If the rule is set to `record`, then the window size is the number of records to retrieve. 
        * If the rule is set to `datetime`, then the window size is a duration string which should conform to Scala Duration.
    example: 14d
  windowOffset:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Set window offset back from the current reference date. 
      By default, the offset is absent and the window starts from the current reference date. 
        * If the rule is set to `record`, then the window offset is the number of records to skip from the reference date.
        * If the rule is set to `datetime`, then the window offset is a duration string which should conform to Scala Duration.
    example: 3d
